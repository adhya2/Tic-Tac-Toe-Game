# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game. This project allows two players to play the game in turns on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
